During your Professional Development week you will present what you have so far of your portfolio to your classmates.  Your portfolio doesn't need to be completed but it does need to be in a presentable form.  Below are a few resources to get started.

## Deploying Via GitHub Pages
GitHub offers every member one special repository that can be hosted for free by GitHub. This is a great place to host your portfolio site. If you ever want to use GitHub's special repository to host something else, you can move your portfolio to a different repository.

Read all about <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="blank">GitHub Pages</a> here.

Follow the instructions **exactly!**
- You must have a file named `index.html`
- The name of your repository must be `yourusername.github.io`
- Put your code in this repository - no nested files!
- git add/commit/push like normal
