# How to Ask a Tech Question

Coding is tough. You will run into problems and you will get stuck. Communicating the problem you are experiencing can be as big of a challenge as fixing the problem itself. Here are some helpful tips when you run into problems and get stuck.

* Read the syllabus thoroughly. Look back at other sections that reference the syntax you are working with.

* Talk about your problem! One of the reasons we utilize pair-programming is to encourage communication about coding. If you are both stuck talk to the duck.

* Pseudo coding is the term developers use for translating the code into sentence structure. This can help you create a step by step plan for your problem and a point of reference when you get stuck.

* Learn your programming vocabulary so can correctly identify the problem you are having.

* Double check your indentations and syntax. Use the built in functionality of the text editor to make sure all your tags, parentheses, and curly braces close. Typos are very common errors.

* Read your error messages! Errors are a great way to fix your code. Error messages will often contain the file and the line the error where the error occurred.

* Google your error message and language in which you are coding. You are probably not the first person to have this problem.

* Use dev tools and console.log to inspect the page and look for where your error occurs. Make sure the problem you think you have is actually the problem you have.

* Change one thing at a time, then test it, then make one more change, then test. It is easy to get down a rabbit hole with bug fixing.

* Ask your fellow students for help. They may have come across a similar problem.

* Ask the instructors. We will have you walk through your code so make sure everything is formatted properly and you can explain the problem you are having.
