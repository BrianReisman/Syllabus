# Ruby Hashes

A hash is a collection of unique keys and their values. A hash is like an array, but instead of the values being referenced by an index, the values are referenced by their unique key. Hashes can be constructed in multiple ways.

Keys are strings, and values are assigned using a hash rocket `=>`:

```RUBY
> shopping_cart = { "apples" => 5, "kiwis" => 2 }
```
Key value pairs can be written like a JavaScript object:

```RUBY
> shopping_cart = { granola: "almond", bananas: 3 }
```

Keys are symbols, and values are assigned using a hash rocket `=>`:

```RUBY
> shopping_cart = { :yogurt => 6, :flour => "All Purpose" }
```

For the rest of this class, we'll be using symbols for our keys, because symbols are immutable (every symbol is unique, and it canâ€™t be changed) and more efficient than using strings (see the benchmark data here: [Benchmarking Ruby Symbols vs Strings](https://gist.github.com/matugm/410f46ca87455b2701faa9a88edee8df))

## Symbols

### Symbols vs Strings
Some people confuse symbols with variables, but they have nothing to do with variables. Instead, a symbol is a lot more like a string. As you know by now, strings are used to work with data, but symbols are identifiers. In the above example, `:yogurt` representst the `@yogurt` instance variable. You should use symbols as names or labels for things (like methods) & use strings when you care more about the data (individual characters).

### Symbol Syntax
A symbol looks like a variable name but it's prefixed with a colon. Examples - `:yogurt` & `:flour`. The cool thing about symbols is that you don't have to pre-declare them and they're guaranteed to be unique. 

There's no need to assign some kind of value to a symbol - Ruby takes care of that for you. Ruby also guarantees that no matter where it appears in your program, a particular symbol will have the same value.

Alternatively, you can consider the colon to mean "thing named" so :id is "the thing named id." You can also think of :id as meaning the name of the variable id, and plain id as meaning the value of the variable.

A Symbol is the most basic Ruby object you can create. It's just a name and an internal ID. Symbols are useful because a given symbol name refers to the same object throughout a Ruby program. Symbols are more efficient than strings. Two strings with the same contents are two different objects, but for any given name there is only one Symbol object. This can save both time and memory.


Accessing a value from the hash:

```RUBY
> shopping_cart[:granola]
# => "almond"
```

A hash can also be created through the `new` method:

```RUBY
> shopping_cart = Hash.new
> shopping_cart[:cheese] = "Cheddar"
# --or (if you don't want to use symbols) --
> shopping_cart["lettuce"] = "spring mix"
> shopping_cart
# => {:cheese=>"Cheddar", "lettuce"=>"spring mix"}
```

## each Loop and Hashes

.each calls a block once for each key in the hash, passing the key-value pair as parameters.

If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.
```RUBY
> shopping_cart = { :apples => 5, :kiwis => 2 }
# => {"apples"=>5, "kiwis"=>2}

> shopping_cart.each do |key, value|
    puts "Get #{value} #{key} from the store."
  end
# Get 5 apples from the store.
# Get 2 kiwis from the store.
```
