# Challenge: Car Challenge

## Programmer Stories

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can make a car.
**Hint**:	Create a class called `Car`, and create a variable called `my_car` which contains an object of class `Car`.

**Story**: As a programmer, I can give my car a model on initialization.
- The model for the car class can be "generic car"

**Story**: As a programmer, I can give my car a year on initialization.
- The year for the car class can be "my_car year"

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can tell how many wheels a car has. The default is four.
**Hint**:	`initialize` the car to have four wheels, then create a method to return the number of wheels.

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can make a Tesla car.
**Hint**:	Create an variable called `my_tesla` which is an instance of class `Tesla` which inherits from class `Car`.

**Story**: As a programmer, I can give my Tesla a model on initialization.

**Story**: As a programmer, I can give my Tesla a year on initialization.

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can make a Toyota car.

**Story**: As a programmer, I can give my Toyota a model on initialization.

**Story**: As a programmer, I can give my Toyota a year on initialization.

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can make a Honda car.

**Story**: As a programmer, I can give my Honda a model on initialization.

**Story**: As a programmer, I can give my Honda a year on initialization.

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can turn on and off the lights in my cars. Lights start in the off position.

**Story**:  As a programmer, I can signal left and right. Turn signals starts off.

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can determine the speed of a car. Speed starts at 0 mph.

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can speed my Teslas up by 10 per acceleration.

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can slow my Teslas down by 7 per braking.

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can speed my Toyotas up by 7 per acceleration.

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can slow my Toyotas down by 5 per braking.

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can speed my Hondas up by 5 per acceleration.

**Story**:	As a programmer, I can slow my Hondas down by 2 per braking.

**Story**:  As a programmer, I can call upon a car to tell me all its information.
**Hint**: Implement `to_s` on one or more classes. You can call a super class's `to_s` with super.


### Stretch Challenges

**Story**: As a programmer, I can keep a collection of two of each kind of car model, all from different years.
**Hint**:	Create two of each vehicles, all from different model years, and put them into an array.

**Story**: As a programmer, I can sort my collection of cars based on model year.

**Story**: As a programmer, I can sort my collection of cars based on model.

**Story**: As a programmer, I can sort my collection of cars based on year.
