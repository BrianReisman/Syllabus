# Cat Tinder Fetch for Delete Functionality

## Overview
- It is time to delete a cat from our database!
- We will have two applications running on our machine at the same time. The Rails app will run on `localhost:3000` and the React app will run on `localhost:3001`.

## Learning Objectives
- Implementing fetch to delete an existing item from our Rails database

## Set Up
- The Rails app will run on `localhost:3000`
- The React app will run on `localhost:3001`

#### Cloud 9 Users
Be sure and review the [instructions](../../Rails-C&V/postman.md) on exposing a Cloud 9 app to the world like we did for Wildlife Tracker with Postman.  
Start your Rails server: port `8080` for AWS  
Start your React server: `$ rails s -b 0.0.0.0` for 8081 on AWS
